# Robust Bayesian Inference for Discrete Outcomes with the Total Variation Distance

This repository contains the code used to generate the results in the paper ``Robust Bayesian Inference for Discrete Outcomes with the Total Variation Distance''.

`NPL.py' implements a simplified version of nonarametric Bayesian Learning; 'likelihood_functions.py' provide a range of likelihood classes to use with NPL.
